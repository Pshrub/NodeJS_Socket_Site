# NodeJS_Socket_Site 

Site to teach myself Node.js, the socket.io library and 
the Mocha test framework. 

This simple website allows for a user to come to the site,   
join an existing chatroom or create a new room, and exchange 
chat messages with other people in the chat room.

This site was patterned after an example in Node.js In Action.
